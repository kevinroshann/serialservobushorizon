# Implementaion of Multiple Serial servo bus

In this task we are going to implement multiple serial servo bus implementation
# First
we need to create a simple simulation of working servo contrl in arduino and simulate in in tinkercad
which is when an array is given to the controller the servos move in the desired position

successfull implemented the tinkercad simulation

# Second 
we need to implement it on real hardware instead of servos in tinker cad we will have a controller
and we connect servos serially to that controller
we need to assing the id to the servos if it is not already set
then we need to change the code a bit like initialising tx rx ports for the bus and use id to control the servos

succesfully created the code
